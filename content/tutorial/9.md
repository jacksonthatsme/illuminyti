# Need to know

##  If a mission doesn’t need to be done at a specific location, you can complete it at any point in the day.

##  You must always stay with your group. Points will not be given to missions finished without all members present.

##  You likely won’t make all the rendezvous. Solve as many clues as you can and plan the most strategic route.

## You must upload all of your missions to the designated photo album by 6pm. Uploads after 6pm, will not count.
