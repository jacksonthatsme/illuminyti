##  You must always stay with your group. Points will not be given to missions finished without all members present.

##  You must upload all of your missions to the designated photo album by 6pm. Uploads after 6pm, will not count.

##  You may only use public transportation and your feet to get around throughout the operation. If you are caught using other means, you will be docked.
